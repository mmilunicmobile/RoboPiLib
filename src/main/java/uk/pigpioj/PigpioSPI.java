	 * behaviour of 4-wire operation, mode 0, active low chip select.
	 * An auxiliary SPI device is available on the A+/B+/Pi2/Zero and may be selected
	 * by setting the A bit in the flags. The auxiliary device has 3 chip selects and
	 * a selectable word size in bits.
	 * spiFlags consists of the least significant 22 bits.
